          even in very simple scenes. This is because Unity has to do a lot of background
          processes to refresh things.

        m_Untranslated: "Luckily Unity has some ways to speed that up massively.\n\nThere
          are more, but Unity gives users control over two very significant processes
          when starting play mode:\n1. <b>Reload Scene</b>\n Destroys all GameObjects
          in the editor and reloads the scene *from disk*, as it would when loading
          a scene in a build.\n2. <b>Reload Domain</b>\nResets the entire C# State; 
          all static fields, properties, and event handlers are reset when entering
          Play Mode.\n\nToggling both off can easily lead to a 10x speedup in starting
          play mode.\n\nGo to <b>Edit > Project Settings > Editor</b>,  then search
          for <b>Enter Play Mode Settings</b> -Toggle it on, and configure the settings
          how you like.\n\nThe reason these processes aren't disabled by default
          is that there are some caveats to it.\n\n<b>NOTE:</b> If you choose to
          disable Reload Domain, you'll need to edit your scripts to handle these
          resets manually, since they <i>do need to happen</i>!:\n\nIf you don't
          use any static fields, properties or event handlers yourself, there's not
          much to worry about, but if you do, or you use third-party assets it's
          something to look out for, because they might do and not account for this
          setting.\nFor this demo project it's not an issue, but if you choose to
          use these settings in your own project, definitely forward the documentation
          below to your programmer(s).\n<a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DomainReloading.html\">Unity
